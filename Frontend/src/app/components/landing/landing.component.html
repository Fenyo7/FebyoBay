  <h1>Welcome to GreenBay!</h1>
  <p>
    GreenBay is a simple eBay clone where users can sign in to sell and buy
    items. Explore a wide range of items available for sale, or list your own
    items to reach potential buyers.
  </p>

  <p>
    First, you should register to the application, or log in if you're already a user! Then, you can look at each item, and buy them if 
    you have enough money. You don't? Don't worry! You can always get more by magical means! You should just click on the button that displays your balance.
    Gamble responsibly!
  </p>

  <p>
    You can put an item up for sale as well, just click the "Sell an Item" button! Give it a name, a description and name a price.
    Then, you should search for an image, and put the link in. (Sometimes this can be a bit wonky. Try getting one from amazon :D)
  </p>

  <p>
    I hope you have fun here, even if there's not much to do.
  </p>
